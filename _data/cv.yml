career:
 - position: IT Specialist
   company: Parragon Publishing, Inc. (ADC Integrated Systems)
   location: Milan, TN
   dates: April 2016 - current
   summary: Hired during last two semesters of college. I worked part-time and was later hired full-time as soon as I graduated in December 2016. I provided various services ranging from basic IT Support on a helpdesk level, Server administration, and applications programming and troubleshooting as well as other non-IT related services when needed. 
   accomplishments:
    - accomplishment: Upgraded the documentation at the local facility from fileserver to OneNote based documentation. This provided for more resolutions to be documented as well as easier searching of previously solved problems in order to save time repeating troubleshooting steps.
    - accomplishment: Implemented DIY ticketing system: there was none in place. I crafted a ticketing & notification system out of Google Forms & IFTTT to notify myself and my colleagues when problems arise. This is still in use today.
    - accomplishment: Upgraded the host capacity of the network: network was previously \24 and could only host 254 hosts. I increased the scope to \23 and took note of the devices which would need to be statically assigned to decrease the DHCP range as well.
    - accomplishment: Upgraded the networking equipment: the facility was paying for a ~1Gbps fiber line, but the networking equipment could not host this. With permission, my colleagues and I upgraded the networking equipment (router, switches, and cabling where necessary) to accomodate the Gigabit speeds.
    - accomplishment: Maintained SQL Server 2012: the facility based operations on a SQL Server and its accompanying applications (.NET, IIS, etc.) I provided administrative support when the server ran slow by tuning its configuration, running queries to find bad SQL jobs, and providing SSRS reports to the users for business metrics.
    - accomplishment: Application Development: Along with the SSRS reports, I also built a .NET/C# application to assist with data entry, a Python application with automated a pre-existing application, and a NativeScript smartphone application which runs on Android and iOS which connects to the facilities SQL server to retrieve inventory data.
